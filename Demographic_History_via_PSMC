# Demographic History via PSMC

Here, we will apply PSMC (Pairwise Sequential Markovian Coalescent) with bootstrap replicates to infer population size history from an individual's genome sequence. To read more about this software program, or to download, visit [PSMC](https://github.com/lh3/psmc).

Apply PSMC and bootstrapping through the following steps:

1) Prepare data
2) Separate file
3) Run PSMC on data
4) Run bootstrap replicates 
5) Combine outputs
6) Generate plot

Be sure that modules are available and loaded on your HPC, and submit a job script with the following code. Here, we included all of the steps listed above into one job file.

```Bash
echo + `date` job $JOB_NAME started in $QUEUE with jobID=$JOB_ID on $HOSTNAME
#
# 1) Prepare data: locate the fastq file of the genome you want to analyze, and convert it from fastq to psmc format
fq2psmcfa -q20 /path/to/input/fastq_file.fq.gz > /path/to/output/psmcfa_file.psmcfa
#
# 2) Separate file: split the file into smaller files for PSMC input
splitfa /path/to/input/psmcfa_file.psmcfa > /path/to/output/split_psmcfa_file.split.psmcfa
#
# 3) Run PSMC on data: run PSMC with specified parameters on the psmc file to infer population size history
psmc -N25 -t15 -r5 -p "4+25*2+4+6" -o /path/to/output/psmc_output_file.psmc /path/to/input/psmcfa_file.psmcfa
#
# 4) Run bootstrap replicates: will run 100 replicates of PSMC in parallel using 4 processes at a time
seq 100 | xargs -P 4 -i echo psmc -N25 -t15 -r5 -b -p "4+25*2+4+6" -o round-{}.psmc /path/to/input/split_psmcfa_file.split.psmcfa | sh
#
# 5) Combine outputs: combine original PSMC output file with the 100 bootstrap replicate output into single file
cat /path/to/input/psmc_output_file.psmc round-*.psmc > /path/to/output/combined_psmc_output_file.combined.psmc
#
# 6) Generate plot
psmc_plot.pl -g 4 -u 1e-8 -X 1000000 /path/to/input/combined_psmc_output_file.combined /path/to/output/psmc_plot_file
#
echo + `date` job $JOB_NAME started in $QUEUE with jobID=$JOB_ID on $HOSTNAME
```
