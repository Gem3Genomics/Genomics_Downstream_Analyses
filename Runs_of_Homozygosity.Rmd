**Runs of Homozygosity (ROH)** Is defined as uninterrupted segments of homozygous sites in an individual's genome.

We will use bcftools to analyze Runs of Homozygosity (RoH) and plot results in R. To read more about bcftools or to download, visit [bcftools](https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/howtos/roh-calling.html).

Be sure that the programs are available and loaded on your HPC, and run the following code on an interactive or computational node:

```Bash
#Apply bcftools RoH command
bcftools roh --AF-dflt 0.4 -I -G30 --rec-rate 1.4e-9 /path/to/file/file_all_individuals.vcf.gz > /path/to/file/file_all_individuals.roh.txt

#Explanation
#bcftools roh: This command runs the roh plugin from bcftools to detect runs of homozygosity
#AF-dflt 0.4: This option sets the default allele frequency to 0.4 when the frequency is missing in the input file
#I: This option tells the plugin to perform the imputation of missing genotypes
#G30: This option sets the phred-scaled genotype quality threshold to 30, #Genotypes below this quality threshold will be treated as missing
#rec-rate 1.4e-9: This option sets the recombination rate to 1.4e-9
```
Optional: filter and process the output file to retain specific information such as chromosome and location of runs of homozygosity:

```Bash
grep "RG" file_all_individuals.roh.txt | cut -f 2,3,6 > file_all_individuals.roh.edited.txt
```

Run the following code in R to analyze results:

```R
# Load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(ggrepel)

#Read data with read_delim() for better control over input file parsing
clouded_roh <- read_delim("NN_6samples_HD_PASS_DP5.roh.edited.txt", delim = "\t", skip = 1, col_names = c("Sample", "Chromosome", "RoH_length"))

#Compute NROH and Sum of ROH (SROH)
clouded_nroh <- clouded_roh %>% 
  group_by(Sample) %>% 
  summarize(NROH = n())

clouded_sroh <- clouded_roh %>% 
  group_by(Sample) %>% 
  summarize(SROH = sum(RoH_length))

#Compute FROH
clouded_froh <- inner_join(clouded_nroh, clouded_sroh, by = "Sample") %>% 
  mutate(FROH = NROH / SROH)

#Create a table with NROH, SROH, and FROH for each sample
summary_table <- clouded_froh

#Display the table
print(summary_table)

#Save the table to a CSV file
write_csv(summary_table, "summary_table.csv")

#Plot NROH vs. SROH and save the plot to a file
froh_plot <- inner_join(clouded_nroh, clouded_sroh, by = "Sample") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = SROH, y = NROH)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = Sample)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(title = "NROH vs. SROH")

ggsave("froh_plot.png", froh_plot, width = 8, height = 6, dpi = 300)

#Create a boxplot of RoH lengths for each sample and save the plot to a file
roh_boxplot <- clouded_roh %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Sample, y = RoH_length)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(title = "RoH Lengths per Sample")

#Save plot as PNG
ggsave("roh_boxplot.png", roh_boxplot, width = 8, height = 6, dpi = 300)
```
